# Sound Speed Difference

The ultimate goal of this thesis project is to calculate the sound speed difference. To this end, we write a few functions that perform this implementation as described especially in `variable.py` which works towards the `sound_speed_diff` function which takes as argument just a `baryon_list`, `lepton_list`, `meson_list` and the `data` dataframe and returns an array of the sound speed difference values as a function of baryon density `nB`.
