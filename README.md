Thesis project involves calculating the sound speed difference (difference between the adiabatic and equilibrium sound speeds; these are defined as the
partial derivative of the pressure at fixed composition and total derivative of the pressure respectively) in the core of a neutron star
for varying types of compositions. 

In particular, there are two main ways that this can be done. 
1. Pressure Partial Derivative
2. Chemical Potential Partial Derivatives
