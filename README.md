Thesis project involves calculating the sound speed difference (difference between the adiabatic and equilibrium sound speeds; these are defined as the
partial derivative of the pressure at fixed composition and total derivative of the pressure respectively) in the core of a neutron star
for varying types of compositions. 

In particular, few ways this is done:
